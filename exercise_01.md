# Lesson 1
## Examples of tasks where *I think* the multiprocessing pool might be helpful:

* compressing files
* hashing files
* in general, processing files simultaneously
* memoizing recursive functions (factorials, prime numbers...)
* scanning (and/or processing) chunks of a large data structure or file in parallel
* interacting with APIs
* analyzing different descriptive aspects of a data structure (counting number of elements, compressibility, checksum...)
* applying processor intensive functions to items in an iterable (both exhaustively or conditionally)
* demons/watchdogs
* GPU accelerated computing
* ML/DL
* robotics
* games
* simulations
* mutation testing
* ...
